True Friendship is a treasure that no can easily possess. God gave us the liberty to choose friends because they will be with us till the last breath. Loving someone related to us is a natural tendency. Loving and caring for someone whom you met as a stranger but grew up to be the best buds is a totally different feeling of extolment. Gradually they become the best relation and the top most priority. Friendship is nothing but true and pure love without any kind of apprehension in return.
True friends always support each other even during the hardest of times. A true friend is one who feels celebrates our success, on the other hand, who teaches us in our failures. A true friend criticizes the wrong but appreciates the good in us to improve our self awareness and confidence. They indoctrinate the right and change us for the better. Thatâ€™s why it is said that a  true friend is worth more than a million other possessions. Love from your friend will always be unconditional. They may expect nothing from us but shower their love always.
