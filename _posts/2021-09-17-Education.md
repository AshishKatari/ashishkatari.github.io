The importance of education in life is immense. It facilitates quality learning to people throughout their life. It inculcates knowledge, belief, skill, values and moral habits. It improves the way of living and raises the social and economic status of individuals. Education makes life better and peaceful. It transforms the personality of individuals and makes them feel confident.
 Nelson Mandela said, “Education is the most powerful weapon to change the world”. 
 Education gives us knowledge of the world around us. It develops in us a perspective of looking at life. It is the most important element in the evolution of the nation. Without education, one will not explore new ideas. It means one will not able to develop the world because without ideas there is no creativity and without creativity, there is no development of the nation.
