A welcoming and care-free attitude that encaptures every bike enthusiastic. The leader in the  H'ness dominated segment. A newer, refined version, the RE Meteor 350. 
The myth, the aura and the hype that surrounds every RE machine built till now, has totally encapsuled this newly launched beast. 
Acclaimed to be a totally tough rider like any other RE, this rather proves to be a better cruiser than the out going Thunderbird.
With the dynamics and the ethos of the RE legacy changing, the showrooms now feel like a retro themed fashion apparel Store with all the accessories curated perfectly in unison. 
The mashimo oozed by every RE rings in the hearts of the man of today's world. With better engines, aftermarket upgrades and improved services, RE has definitely added a feather to it's hat in it's plan to dominate the 2 wheeler markets. And with the newer meteor, RE breaks the age old tradition of power over tech. 
It uses a newer chassis, a refined engine, a well accustomed gearbox to deliver what a RE truly does. 
And this one, doesn't need any introduction. It rather feels like a dictator of the roads.
