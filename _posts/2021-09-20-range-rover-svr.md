The only premium SUV in existence of the best off road capability, the Range Rover is one of the Marvels of engineering. Powered by a V8 naturally aspirated engine, it revvs up enough to hit a top speed of about 250kmph. A masculine hunk on road and a total beast off it. 
With posh interiors and healthy drive dynamics, the Range Rover has come a long way from a full time rover to a timeless classic...
The Range Rover, a dynamic machine of fine English engineering boasts of top notch features that we fail to notice in it's competitors. A car that has everything and anything, a great physics, the best in class engine, decent interiors and a world class finish. A truly magnificent scene to look at. The car itself holds numerous records of conquering the highest peaks and going past the most untrodden lands. 
As it's tagline says, 'Go above and beyond.'
A car that is built for any road. A car that I'd built for no road too.
